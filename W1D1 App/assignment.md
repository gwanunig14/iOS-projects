Voxer

This is the app I use the most. The buttons are just the right size with one exception, more on that later. Main color scheme is orange and black so everything has a stark contrast. All of the navigation goes exactly where you want and would expect. It, of course, is always asking me to pay for the upgrade which contains features I don't want. The audio file buttons overlap with their play buttons so you find yourself selecting the file when you don't want to a lot. The only real not buttons are pictures and they just get bigger.


Groupon

This one is rarely used but finding the coupons you actually purchased is a little hard to find. Colors, again, contrast well and the buttons are a good size.

Did you want us to do this with all of them?

Write

I have two major problems with this one. First it's a word processor that I got to write while I'm out and about but it limits you to a very low number of characters.
Second, to get out of your file and back to the menu you have to swipe rather than press the back button because that closes the app and nothing tells you this counter intuitive fact.
Beyond that, it certainly gets the job done. and everything works well and it looks good.

Waze
I love this app. Everything was easy to find. The button icons make sense. It's just great. The only thing is quitting it is a process.

Youtube
This doesn't work well to me. I do things by accident all the time and we've all experienced the video just deciding to stop loading for no apparent reason. Beyond that, I guess the design is solid.

Play Music
Another app that I really have no complaints about. Everything works well and is designed well. Any bad thing I have to say is attributed to the fact that I have Metro.

ESV Bible
This is probably my best functioning app. Everything does exactly what you want and expect it to do. Nothing has been hard to find.

Facebook
Let's not go there.

Podkicker
This one gets the job done but its navigation is crap. My fiance had it for three months before she figured out how to find podcasts and I only did by accident. Visually, it's really plain, but I don't mind.

Countdown Widget
This is just a silly thing I have counting down to my wedding but it's appearance is really lame unless you use in app purchases but I can't spare any money right now.

To be honest, I didn't know what you mean about fields and sign ups. I didn't realize that until I got home and it dodn't seem like an emergency.
